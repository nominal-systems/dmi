# Directory of Services
The test codes supported for each provider can be obtained using the [get directory of services](/docs/dmi/api/operations/list-provider-services) endpoint. This will return a list of available test codes for a specific provider, along with any extra requisition information that should be send in the order for specific services/tests.

See the [ProviderService](/docs/dmi/schemas/provider-service) schema in the API Reference for more information.
