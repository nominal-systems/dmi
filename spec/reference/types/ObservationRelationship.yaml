    description: | 
      A code specifying the kind of relationship that exists with the target resource:
        - has-member: This observation is a group observation (e.g. a battery, a panel of tests, a set of vital sign measurements) that includes the target as a member of the group.
        - sequel-to: This observation follows the target observation (e.g. timed tests such as Glucose Tolerance Test).
        - replaces: This observation replaces a previous observation (i.e. a revised value). The target observation is now obsolete.
        - qualified-by: The value of the target observation qualifies (refines) the semantics of the source observation (e.g. a lipemia measure target from a plasma measure)
        - interfered-by: The value of the target observation interferes (degrades quality, or prevents valid observation) with the semantics of the source observation (e.g. a hemolysis measure target from a plasma potassium measure which has no value).
        - is-interpretation-of: The value of the target observation is an interpretation of this observation (e.g. low, high, normal).
    example: has-member

      - has-member
      - sequel-to
      - replaces

  target:
    type: string
    description: The target resource that belongs to the observation.
