# Utility Scripts

This directory contains small utility scripts used when working with DMI.
The `run.js` program provides an interactive way to run the available scripts.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the values for your environment.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Execute the runner:

```bash
node run.js
```

You will be prompted to choose one of the scripts and review or override its
configuration values before execution.
